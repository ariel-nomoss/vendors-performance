# Description

The intention of this project is the performance analysis of the vendors that will replace WordPress.

# How?

Using the module `lighthouse-batch` we can get the lighthouse data from several websites at once. 

The raw data can be found in the `./data` folder for HubSpot and Webflow. Each of them have a report for each website and a `summary.json` file.

# Analysis done until now

- Average score of each vendor using the `summary.json` file.
